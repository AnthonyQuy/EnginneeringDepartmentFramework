# Framework Stack

## Front-End (FE)

Our front-end framework stack includes the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript, enhancing code reliability and developer productivity.
- Node.js: A JavaScript runtime that allows server-side execution and seamless communication between front-end and back-end components.

## Back-End (BE)

For the back-end, we utilize the following technologies:

- Node.js: A high-performance JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- Express: A lightweight web application framework for building APIs and handling server-side operations.

## Quality Assurance (QA)

To ensure the quality and reliability of our software, we incorporate the following QA technologies:

- WebdriverIO (WDIO): A test automation framework for writing automated tests for web applications.
- Selenoid: A Selenium-compatible solution for running browser tests in Docker containers.
- Report Portal: A test reporting and analysis platform for tracking test results and generating reports.

## Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

Our CI/CD workflow involves the following technologies:

- Docker: A platform for creating isolated and reproducible environments.
- Build Pipelines: Automated processes for building and deploying software updates.
- Jenkins: An open-source automation server for orchestrating the CI/CD pipeline and facilitating deployment to production.

By leveraging this comprehensive framework stack, we combine the power of React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Node.js, Express, WDIO, Selenoid, Report Portal, Docker, build pipelines, and Jenkins to deliver robust, scalable, and high-quality software applications.
